						<p>Without committing to an order, this is an easy way to check your LLC name before filing it. For all 50 states (except, Delaware, Florida and Nevada, which Incnow processes internally at the advertised prices), when you submit your LLC name request, Incnow will submit your request to our affiliate instantly for them to check the name and get back to you as soon as possible with the availability of the name for filing.</p>
						<p>The affiliate will then request the order information and let you know the package options. Should you find a lower advertised price for identical services, at the time of the order, the affiliate will match that price, pursuant to their terms of use. Services will then be provided by the affiliate as the formation agent and also registered agent should you request a registered agent. The affiliate will then manage the relationship without Incnowâ€™s involvement.</p>
						<p>While Incnow cannot provide a price quote at this time or a list of packages, we do expect the affiliate to provide the price and package options to your satisfaction prior to your order.  We appreciate your business and hope you find this process to be easy, convenient and affordable. Thank you.</p>
